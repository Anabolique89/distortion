# JS-Exercise, The Distortion Bar

Hi Devs, It's Distortion time, so your task is to create a data-visualization for a bar called FooBar.

The bar needs a visualization on how many people are currently in queue to get a cold beer. You can see the data right here:

The data refreshes every 10 seconds, so if you caould set of the service to fetch every 10 seconds or so, that would be great.

## Requirements
 - You must create a service that shows the amount of people in queue.
 - The service must ask for data regularly, like every 10-20 seconds
 - The visualization should be more than just a number (you can find inspiration below)
 
## The visualization
 - The amount of people in queue can never be greater than 25
 - Feel free to come up with something interesting
 - Animations are awesome
 - How about a "speed gauge?"
 - Or a chart?
 - Or ...
